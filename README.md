# gomokuLiveGame

Gomoku has been a meaningful part of my computer science journey. After completing my first year of undergraduate studies, I had acquired a basic understanding of programming. In the first semester of my second year, I developed my first complete coding project—a Gomoku game built with C# that included a graphical user interface, not just terminal-based interaction.

In the following semester, after completing the *Algorithms and Data Structures* course, I extended the game to support human vs. computer gameplay using rule-based logic. Although it wasn’t powered by AI, the program functioned well and served as my Year 2 project. Many of my classmates had to try several times before they could beat it.

In Year 3, as I gained deeper knowledge of computer networking and improved my programming skills, I attempted to transform the Gomoku game into a multiplayer version. Due to limitations in accessing web servers at the time, I implemented a LAN-based version instead, allowing local multiplayer gameplay.

Now, for this project, I plan to develop an Internet-based live Gomoku game that allows users to match with opponents online. It will be implemented using the .NET framework and deployed in a Docker environment throughout both development and deployment phases.

Additionally, once the multiplayer mode is complete, I plan to integrate my earlier human vs. computer version into this project as well.
